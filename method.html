            <br> 
            What makes a good visual identity work for others does not necessarily apply to your business, your market, or your personality. 
            <br>
            <br> Specific design features in a company belong to this company. <br> Trying to replicate them does not make your brand unique. <br> This is why studying your identity is so important.
            <br> We create your brand from the ground up with your own roots.
            </p>

    <section class="intro-text ctr">
        <h2>The reason your products or services are unique is how you present them to the world. </h2>
        <p>
            <br>
            Anything can be found anywhere else in the world, cheaper and delivered faster. 
            <br>
            <br>
            What drives potential customers to your company is your brand. It is made of everything potential clients would like to feel about a company, and what they say about it, and about you. <br> What makes them feel special could be anything, or this very thing in particular. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The thing is, until your brand is not fully developed, you do not have access to this information yet.
                <br> Unless we use a different approach.</p>

            <h2>We need to understand the behavior of your potential clients before designing anything. </h2>
            <br>
            <p>Developing your brand from your clientâ€™s perspective gives us the clarity to target specific patterns that attract interested visitors and turn them into dream customers. Once your dream customers are happy and satisfied, you start growing a tribe (community) made of individuals that share same passions, goals, and activities. </p>
            <br>
            <p>So there are things that a lot of customers have in common. Not only do they share similar fundamental human feelings, but they also share brands. 
               <br> A brand is unique but it has the particularity to be shared amongst tribes.</p>

            <h2>STYLESCAPES</h2>
            <p>Stylescapes are the evolution of moodboards. 

                They aim to tell a visual story by being homogeneous and coherent with the briefing.

        <p>Gives you a visual environment as close as possible to your expectations: strong identity, no less, no more.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>The "Younger"</h3>
        <p>"Same, same, but different". A little twist on top of what is expected from the briefing. This "je ne sais quoi" that highlights the brand personality.</p>

    <div class="card text-upper">
        <h3>The "Oldest"</h3>
        <p>Completely different from his 2 brothers. The eccentric brother with the wild style everyone does not dare to try on.
            <br>
            This design components are pushed to the extreme. 
            <br>
            It polarizes the brand and reinforces its uniqueness.

            Not suitable for everyone.</p>
